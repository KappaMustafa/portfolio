            My name is Mustafa Aboghalyoun, I am a first generation
            Syrian-American. I spend most of my time learning how to improve my
            development skills, as well as learning new coding languages. I am
            passionate about games and I plan on learning how to program and
            develop games in the near future. I recently graduated from the Web
            Development Bootcamp from the University Of Minnesota.
